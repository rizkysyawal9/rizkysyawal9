### Hi there, Rizky here ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a final year student at IPB University trying my best to graduate. I do a lot of Frontend Programming mostly using Vue frameworks and occasionally Flutter for mobile apps on request. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on graduating on time
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Nuxt/React projects and Flutter Design Patterns
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Node.js Programming
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [my personal website](https://www.rizkysyawals.live/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to sketch and design other stuff besides tech
